Conditional rendering in react :

Conditional rendiring refers to what we need to show in the UI, based on the conditional we will display UI

3 ways for conditional rendering:

1. if/else
2. termary operator (condition ? ecpression1 ; expression2)
3. logical AND operator (short circuit operator) && (handles only the true case)
