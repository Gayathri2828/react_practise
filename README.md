<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Components:
Components are the independent resuable bits of code which creates part of user interface. 

Examples of UI:
1. Button
2. Image
3. Heading
4. Card
5. Footer
6. Home screen
7. About screen

Componebts were created in the .js, ,jsx ,.tsx
js- javascript
jsx- javascript XML
tsx- typescript XML

note: in a file we can create as many as components(.js we can many components)

Types of components:
we have 2 types of components in react

1. Functional based components -> A component designed using plain js functions.
2. Class based components-> A component designed using classes in js.

Component
Every component must start with the capital letter.
Every component can return the markup.
Component can be as small as the button or as large as a screen (page).

***React is completely a component based approach
We will design a componet, will resue the component

Example: I will creat button component, i will use the button component where ever the button appears

ordered list
1. apple
2. banana

unordered list
1. apple
2. banana

ol- li
ul- li

git push --set-upstream origin main

JSX:

every componemmt returns the markp(HTML) -->
