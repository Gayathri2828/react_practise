JSX:
Javascript and xml , This is the special syntax that react will follow , it looks like a html but its not
This syntax allows us to write the html inside our javascript file

Using this is can write both html and javascript in a single file 
Every component can returns the JSX(HTML+JS)
Only react will allows this type of syntax

Rules of JSX :
1. Every component must return a single parent (which is a shared container) or else we can also ues React fragments.
2. Every attribute must be in a camelCase ex: onClick, onMouseOver, onSubmit
3. html class must be replaced with className

Class is predefined keyword in react for ceacting class used components - ClassName

4. Every js code inside the return must writen inside the curly braces
